<h1 align="center">Cute Cat Contest: The Ultimate Feline Face-Off</h1>

<!-- # Cute Cat Contest -->
Unleash your inner cat-lover and put your cute-o-meter to the test with 'Cute Cat Contest'! Two cats enter, only one leaves as the cutest. Can you handle the feline pressure? Meow-velous fun guaranteed 🐱

# About
Discover the cutest cats on the internet with "Cute Cat Contest"! I stumbled upon [thecatapi](https://thecatapi.com/) and was so enamored with all the cute cat pics/gifs, I decided to create a website on them.


# How it works
The website shows you two random cats and asks you to choose which one you think is cuter. That's all you need to do. Choose the cutest cat and move forward to choose again. It's simple, fun, and you get to admire some cute cats along the way.

# What happens next?
Well, that's for you to find out. All I'll say is, keep an open mind and be ready for anything. After all, life is full of surprises, and this website is no exception. 😉

# Give it a Try!
Go to [cute cat contest](https://cocomo29.github.io/cute-cat-contest/) and get ready to be whisked away on a journey of feline fun. 🐱😻
